# Connecting-the-first-Search-
This repository contains the assignment work of the project 'Connecting the first search' offered by Stamatics IIT kanpur
## What the project does
This project contains a complete postmortem of Graph Theory. The analysis of most of the algorithms and concepts of Graph Theory has been attempted through well-commented codes.
## Why the project is useful
The audience will get to see the codes for all the algorithms and concepts of Graph Theory. It also contains codes for some selected problems in Graph Theory
## How the users can get started with the project
The users can first refer to any standard book to acquaint them with the theoretical knowledge of Graph Theory. 'Introduction to Algorithms' by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein is preferred.
